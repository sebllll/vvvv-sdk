    *
    * The three on-board sensors used on a 3-Space Sensor are a gyroscope, and accelerometer, and a compass.
    * The gyroscope expresses rates of rotations about each of its major axes.
    * The accelerometer expresses any experienced accleration about each of its major axes.
    * The compass expresses a three dimensional vector pointed towards magnetic north.
